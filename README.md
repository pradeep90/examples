Example repository showing how to add shape types in PyTorch and Numpy code.

To play around with shape types in a Numpy sample, see [numpy_simple_demo.py](./numpy_simple_demo.py).

# Other code

NOTE: Right now, we are [focusing](https://github.com/pradeep90/pytorch_examples/blob/master/.pyre_configuration#L3) only on one directory `time_sequence_prediction`. Once we are happy with the stubs for it, we can start looking at other directories as well.
